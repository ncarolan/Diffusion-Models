# Graph Diffusions Models

This project contains four models for contaigon spread on networks. The first three models (SI,SIS,SIR) are standard epidemic models. They are run on a radnomly generated ER graph and produce visualizations of network conditions over time. The fourth model concerns the spread of memes (information) on social networks where agents have limited attention spans.

### Susceptible-Infected Model



### Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Model



### Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Model


### Social Network Model: Memetic Spread Under Limited Attention

This model is based on the one implmented by Weng et.al. in:
